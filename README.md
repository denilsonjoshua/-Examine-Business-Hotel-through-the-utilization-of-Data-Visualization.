# -Examine-Business-Hotel-through-the-utilization-of-Data-Visualization.
In this mini project, I took on the role of a data scientist in a hotel company. As a data scientist, my task was to provide insights related to the hotel business performance. I began by performing data preprocessing to prepare for the next steps, which involved analyzing the months/seasons that experienced an increase or decrease in hotel bookings. Next, I delved into analyzing the correlation between the length of stay and the cancellation rate of hotel bookings. In the final stage, I examined the correlation between the time gap between the booking and the cancellation rate. The results showed that the lowest cancellation rate occurred for bookings with a waiting period of less than 30 days, applicable to both types of hotels. The Resort Hotel maintained a relatively stagnant cancellation ratio of 40%, while the City Hotel experienced a considerably higher ratio (60%) when the waiting period was around one year.
